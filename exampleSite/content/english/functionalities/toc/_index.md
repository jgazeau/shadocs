# Description
---

By default in the theme, each content page (except homepage) generates a table of contents associated with the titles defined in the page.  
It is possible to activate or deactivate this functionnality, both globally (sitewide) or per-page, with the following considerations:
* the homepage never contains the table of contents
* the configuration key to use is `toc`
* without configuration, the table of contents is enabled globally (sitewide)
* the following configuration precedence apply (from highest to lowest):
    * page configuration
    * site configuration
* the following configuration is used to activate/deactivate the table of content globally (sitewide)
    ```
    [params]
      toc = true/false
    ```
* the following configuration is used to activate/deactivate the table of content on a single page (to define in the front matter)
    ```
    ---
    toc: false
    ---
    ```

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
When activated, the table of contents is only available when the window width is greater than 1024 pixels.
