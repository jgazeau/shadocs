# Description
---

By default in the theme, it is possible to import libraries or third-party code into the generated html page, using the website configuration.

The several types of imports managed by the theme are the following ones:

| Import type | Comment |
| ----------- | ------- |
| **SASS files** (.sass) |{{< md >}}
* Imported in `<head>` tag as `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">` after being [converted as CSS by Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transform-to-css/), grouped and minified in **css/main.css** file
* Paths used for the SASSâž”CSS conversion :
    * assets/bulma
    * assets/sass
{{< /md >}}|
| **CSS files** (.css) |{{< md >}}
* Imported file by file in `<head>` tag as `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">` and minified
{{< /md >}}|
| **Javascript files** (.js) |{{< md >}}
* Imported file by file at the end of the `<body>` tag as `<script type="text/javascript"></script>` and minified

# Define third-party imports
---

To define a file to import you must use the following configuration (*Cf. highlighted lines below*):

{{< snippet
    file="templates/configuration/config.en.toml"
    caption="config.toml ([params] section)"
    codelang="toml"
    codeparam="linenos=inline,hl_lines=[\"38-43\",\"51-67\"]"
/>}}

# Define third-party imports for shortcodes
---

The theme also offers the possibility to import libraries or third-party code associated with a shortcode. These files will be imported only if the shortcode is used in the current page, therefore reducing the loading time of the page.

To define a file to import, associated with a shortcode, you must use the following configuration (*Cf. highlighted lines below*):

{{< snippet
    file="templates/configuration/config.en.toml"
    caption="config.toml ([params] section)"
    codelang="toml"
    codeparam="linenos=inline,hl_lines=[\"38-39\",\"44-49\",\"68-116\"]"
/>}}
