# Description

By default the theme manages the [Hugo taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#readout).

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
A menu located in the navigation bar allows to select a taxonomy and switch to the taxonomies view, depending on the configuration of the website. However, this menu will only appear if at least one taxonomy has been parametrized on the website.
