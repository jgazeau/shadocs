# Hugo, what is it?
---

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a framework (written in [Go](https://golang.org/)) allowing to quickly and easily generate the **static content** of a website.  
Hugo's main concept is to use the content of a site written in [markdown](../markdown/) to generate the associated html code.  
Hugo uses **themes** in order to create a coherent rendering. User can thus concentrate on the content's writing and its structuring without managing its style.
